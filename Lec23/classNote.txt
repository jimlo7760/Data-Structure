Variant data structure

Unrolled linked list: Embedded a fix-length array in each node.

Skip list: store N pointers in the current node, pointing to the Nth node afterward.
Each level contains roughly half the nodes of the previous level, approximately every other node from the previous level.
Start from the highest level, lowering down when the target is lower than the pointer.

Trie / Prefix tree: (an alternative representation of hash table)
The stopping node of the tree is the corresponding value.
