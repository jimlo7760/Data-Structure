// constructor and a two public member variables.  This is one of the
// few times that you are allowed to use non-private member variables.

// NOTE: We could use a boolean (true/false) to represent whether each
// cell of the grid was blocked or open.  This would be the minimal
// representation for memory.

// However, debuggers (both traditional and memory debuggers) might
// not be able to help debug errors with vectors of booleans, if they
// are efficiently packed by a clever STL implementation.  So instead
// we use an enum, to improve readability, and to ensure that the
// status of each grid cell is stored as an integer avoiding debugger
// confusion during development.

// The grid is represented as a 2d vector of GRID_STATUS, with each location
// that is blocked --- meaning that no path can go through --- being
// represented by the value GRID_BLOCKED.  The grid is large enough to
// include all blocked points and include the starting location.  The
// first coordinate of the vector of vectors is the x coordinate, and
// the second is the y coordinate.  The format of the input is
