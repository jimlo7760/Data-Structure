c++ class: (default: private)
- member variables: usually private
- member function: usually public
- cannot directly output by the 'cout', use the function in the class instead.
- when comparing two classes, use a function either.
define:
class class_name{
   public:
        NEED: constructor...
        default constructor: class();
        constructor with argument(s): class(1, 2)

   private:
        (only access/modified within the class)
};

.h: reference from another file

call in main.cpp:
int Date::getYear() const{

}

Only const class can call const class.

customise sort function:
sort(vector.begin(), vector.end(), self-define-rule);
