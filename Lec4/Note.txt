Default constructor:
every parameters have to be initialized. Including STL library. e.g: string = ""

define the operator in the class:
in .h file:
bool operator< (const class_name& first);
in class.cpp file:
bool operator< (const class_name& first, cons class_name& second){
    operating rule;
}

output operator in the class:
in .h file:
std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& ostr, const class_name& n);
in .cpp file:
std:ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& ostr, const Name& n{
    ostr << n.first() << " " << n.last();

}

add:
#ifndef __name_h_
#define __name_h_
...
#endif
to the .h file to prevent errors from multiple includes

"&" should be included in all the "get" function. (attach just after the
 return type)

 comparison function can add "const" and "&" in the parameters
 comparison:
 first > second: sort from greatest to smallest
 first < second: sort from smallest to greatest
